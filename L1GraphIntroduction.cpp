कर्मण्येवाधिकारस्ते मा फलेषु कदाचन।
मा कर्मफलहेतुर्भूर्मा ते सङ्गोऽस्त्वकर्मणि॥

The meaning of the verse is :—
You have the right to work only but never to its fruits.
Let not the fruits of action be your motive, nor let your attachment be to
inaction

/*A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of vertices and edges.
 The vertices are sometimes also referred to as nodes and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph.
  More formally a Graph is composed of a set of vertices( V ) and a set of edges( E ). The graph is denoted by G(V, E).*/

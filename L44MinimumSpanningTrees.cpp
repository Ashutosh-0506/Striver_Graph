The meaning of the verse is :—
You have the right to work only but never to its fruits.
Let not the fruits of action be your motive, nor let your attachment be to
inaction

 Spanning tree is the subset of graph G which has covered all the vertices V of graph G with the minimum possible number of edges.
  Hence we say that a spanning tree doesn’t contain any loop or cycle and it cannot be disconnected.
  
  Spanning tree has V-1 number of edges where V is the number of vertices.

For a complete and undirected graph has maximum possible spanning tree for n number of vertices will be n^(n-2)

Spanning tree doesn’t have any loops and cycle.
